\large{\paragraph{}Increasing numbers of crimes around the globe have created a demand for high
level of safety and security. At the same time with the fast paced world there has
been a requirement to reduce human effort. Many people are increasingly approaching solutions offered by technology to tackle this.

Our project aims at introducing a product in the market that not only ensures
security of a bounded area , but also focuses on safety and right to privacy by maintaining a highly secure data storage system. Designed and realized in this project,
the robot is equipped with a camera and Ultrasonic sensors. This is done with the help of a Raspberry Pi and
Wi-Fi module.

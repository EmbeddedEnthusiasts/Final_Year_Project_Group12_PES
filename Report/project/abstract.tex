\large{\paragraph{}Increasing numbers of crimes around the globe have created a demand for high level of safety and security. At the same time with the fast paced world there has been a requirement to reduce human effort. Many  people are increasingly approaching solutions offered by technology to tackle this.
\newline

Our project aims at introducing a product in the market that not only ensures security of a bounded area , but also focuses on safety and right to privacy by maintaining a highly secure data storage system. Designed and realized in this project, the robot is equipped with a camera, microphone and ultrasonic sensors that  provide remote visuals and audio streams. This is done with the help of a Raspberry Pi and Wi-Fi module. Solar charging of the robot allows conservation of non renewable resources, thus helping us reduce carbon footprint.

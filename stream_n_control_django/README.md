# Note
- Only done the camera streaming part with bare minimum html and css editing, so only streaming is there
- in the main django app called "cam_streaming_and_control_django" I have added "stream" sub app 
- the route for the stream app is **/stream**

# still need to add
- html elements
- authentication (will use django default, it's easy and secured)
- https 
- controling of robot script, will do asap
